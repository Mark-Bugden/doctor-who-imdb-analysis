# Doctor Who IMDb Analysis

Ever wondered which *Doctor Who* seasons were most loved by fans?  
This data science project dives deep into IMDb data to uncover the highs, lows, and hidden gems of the longest-running sci-fi series in TV history. 
We use a data-driven analysis to answer the question: **Who is the best Doctor?**

**Highlights:**
- Rating trends across Doctors and showrunners  
- Statistical analysis of season quality  
- Visual storytelling with clear, intuitive plots  

If you're not into the technical details, check out the non-technical [blog post](https://mark-bugden.github.io./portfolio/doctorwho.html).
Curious to explore the analysis? Simply open the `doctor-who-imdb-analysis.ipynb` notebook to read through it.
Comfortable with Python and want to run it yourself? Just follow the setup instructions in the "Getting Started" section below.
